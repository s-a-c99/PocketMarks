# Drag and Drop Improvements

## Critical Drag & Drop Fixes
- **Fix non-working drag operations** - Debug why bookmarks/folders don't actually move when dragged
- **Fix cursor feedback** - Ensure proper drag cursor states (grabbing/dragged) work correctly
- **Add missing visual effects**:
  - Drag overlay with visual changes (opacity, rotation, shadow)
  - Drop zone indicators when dragging over valid targets
  - Hover effects on droppable areas
  - Visual feedback showing what's being dragged
  - Clear indicators of valid/invalid drop zones

## Debugging Approach
- Check onDragEnd handler is actually firing and updating state
- Verify DragOverlay component is properly configured
- Ensure sensors (pointer, keyboard, touch) are working
- Debug any console errors during drag operations
- Test drag constraints and collision detection

## Visual Improvements
- Add prominent drop zone highlights when dragging
- Show clear visual feedback of dragged item (ghost image)
- Add smooth animations for item repositioning
- Include visual confirmation when drop succeeds
- Add bounce-back animation for invalid drops

## Functionality Verification
- Test bookmark reordering within folders works
- Test folder reordering works  
- Test cross-folder bookmark movement works
- Verify auto-save triggers after successful drops
- Ensure undo functionality works for drag operations
