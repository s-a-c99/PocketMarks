## Philosophy: You Own Your Data

The core principle of PocketMarks is **total user control**. There are no cloud servers and no hidden data synchronization. You own your data, and you decide where it goes. Your bookmarks are stored in a simple `bookmarks.json` file, giving you full ownership.

## Features

- **Organize Your Links:** Create bookmarks and nested folders to keep your links organized.
- **Modern Interface:** A clean and responsive UI with both Light and Dark modes.
- **Mark Favorites:** Use the star icon to mark your most important bookmarks for quick access.
- **Robust Import/Export:**
  - Import bookmarks from standard HTML files exported by any browser.
  - Choose to merge new links with your existing collection or replace it entirely.
  - A comparison view shows you exactly which new bookmarks will be added during a merge.
  - Export all or just a selection of your bookmarks back to a standard HTML file.
- **Dead Link Checker:** Scan your entire collection to find and flag links that are no longer working. Folders containing dead links are also highlighted for easy cleanup.
- **Duplicate Detection:** The app automatically detects when you're trying to add a URL that already exists in your collection and asks for confirmation.
- **Privacy First:** No external tracking or AI API calls. All your data stays within the application.
- **Statistics Dashboard:** Get insights into your collection with a dashboard showing total counts, your most frequently saved domains, and more.

1.  **Download the Code:** Download the project files from this GitHub repository as a ZIP file.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set Up Credentials:** Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project. This file will hold your private username and password. Add the following lines, replacing the example values:
    ```

    ```
    This file is included in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to your repository.
4.  **Run the App:**

    npm run dev
    ```
5.  **Access Your Hub:** Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

## How to Sync Bookmarks Across Devices

The core philosophy of PocketMarks is **total user control**. This means you synchronize bookmarks between your devices (e.g., a laptop and a desktop) manually. This is the essence of true self-hosting, giving you unparalleled privacy and control. The order of bookmarks will be preserved.

Hereâ€™s the recommended workflow to use PocketMarks as your central hub:

### Step 1: Export from PocketMarks
On your main device where PocketMarks is running, use the **Export** function to download a single, up-to-date HTML file containing all your links.

### Step 2: Transfer the File
Move this HTML file to your other device. You can use a USB stick, send it to yourself via a private email, or any method you trust.

### Step 3: Import into Your Browser
1. Open the browser on the second device.
2. Go to the Bookmark Manager (usually `Ctrl+Shift+O` or `Cmd+Shift+O`).
3. For a clean sync, it's best to first **delete all existing bookmarks** from the browser.
4. Use the browser's **Import** function and select the HTML file you transferred.

The browser will **automatically** read the file and add all your bookmarks and folders, recreating the exact structure you had in PocketMarks. You do not need to add them one by one. This ensures your browser is a perfect mirror of your curated collection.

## Password Recovery

Since this is a self-hosted application, there is no traditional "forgot password" feature. You are in full control. Simply open the `.env.local` file on your computer to see the password you set.
